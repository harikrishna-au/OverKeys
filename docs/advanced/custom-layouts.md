# Custom Layouts

The custom layout feature in OverKeys allows you to use your own keyboard layouts defined in a configuration file. This is particularly useful for users who need:

- Specialized layouts not included in the default options
- Custom symbol or function key arrangements
- Language-specific layouts
- Modified versions of standard layouts

## Setup Instructions

### Turning the setting on

1. Open OverKeys
2. Right-click the OverKeys icon in the system tray
3. Select **Preferences**
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle the **Turn on advanced settings** option
6. Toggle the **Use user layouts** option

### Using Configuration File

1. Right-click the OverKeys tray icon
2. Select **Preferences**
3. Go to the **Advanced** tab
4. Click **Open Config**
5. In the JSON file, edit the `userLayouts` array and set the `defaultUserLayout` field:

    ```json
    {
        "userLayouts": [
            {
                "name": "MyCustomLayout",
                "keys": [
                    ["`", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BSPC"],
                    ["Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "[", "]"],
                    ["A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ";", "'"],
                    ["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/"],
                    [" "]
                ]
            }
        ],
        "defaultUserLayout": "MyCustomLayout"
    }
    ```

6. Save the file
7. Right-click the tray icon and click **Reload config** to apply changes

## Default User Layouts

OverKeys no longer comes with default/pre-configured layouts. Instead, you can find sample layouts in the example configuration file at [sample_config.json](../examples/sample_config.json), which includes:

- Extend (navigation and editing keys)
- Symbol (special characters and symbols)
- Arabic (Arabic language keyboard)
- Russian (Russian language keyboard)

You can copy these layouts from the sample configuration to get started with your own custom layouts.

## Creating Custom Layouts

You can create custom layouts by adding them to the `userLayouts` section in the configuration file. Each layout requires a unique name and a keys array that defines the layout structure:

```jsonc
{
    "name": "MyCustomLayout",
    "keys": [
        // Top row (required)
        ["`", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0", "-", "=", "BSPC"],
        // Second row
        ["Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y", "U", "I", "O", "P", "[", "]"],
        // Third row
        ["A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", ";", "'"],
        // Fourth row
        ["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/"],
        // Fifth row
        [" "]
    ]
}
```

You can then set this layout as your default by updating the `defaultUserLayout` field:

```json
{
 "defaultUserLayout": "MyCustomLayout"
}
```

## Format Guidelines

1. **Key Names**: Use standard key symbols or their aliases as defined in the system. For key names and their aliases, see [Supported Keys](../advanced/supported-keys.md).
2. **Layout Structure**: Each row should be defined as an array of keys. At minimum, a layout must have a top row defined.
3. **Language Support**: Unicode characters are supported for international layouts but is only recommended for use on [alternative layouts](../advanced/alternative-layouts.md) as key press state of these characters won't be detected
4. **Flexible Row Lengths**: Your custom layout doesn't need to follow standard row lengths. You can create layouts of any dimension. Here's an example of a compact 4Ã—4 layout:

    ```jsonc
    {
        "name": "Compact4x4",
        "keys": [
        [""], // Mandatory top row, show top row setting turned off
        ["1", "2", "3", "A"],
        ["4", "5", "6", "B"],
        ["7", "8", "9", "C"],
        ["*", "0", "#", "D"]
        ]
    }
    ```

## Row Length Guidelines

While you have flexibility in defining your layout dimensions, the following row lengths are recommended to ensure compatibility across different key styles and visual presentations:

- Top row: 14 keys (including backspace)
- Second row: 12 keys
- Third row: 11 keys
- Fourth row: 10 keys
- Bottom row: 1 key (space bar)

Following these recommendations will help ensure your custom layout displays correctly with different keymap styles in OverKeys.

## Implementation Notes

- Custom layouts are loaded when OverKeys starts or when you toggle the setting.
- If the Kanata integration is enabled, your custom layout will be used as the base layout/layer, and Kanata will control layer switching.
- Custom layouts can be used simultaneously with the alternative layout feature.
- Custom layouts with names identical to the natively supported layouts will override the native ones.

## Troubleshooting

- If your layout displays incorrectly, verify the JSON format in your configuration file.
- Ensure your layout name in `defaultUserLayout` exactly matches one of the names in your `userLayouts` array.
- If you're using symbols or special characters, make sure they're properly escaped in the JSON.
